    At first, the app look likes a chat manager, we have users, rooms and messages (posted by users), 
but, otherwise of a free chat, the rooms of the app are directed to specific context like development 
details of an app, best programming practices among others. So, upon this point of view, we have a domain 
that approach a forum, but in a more simple and less bureaucratic way

    Main Funcionalities
    Creation of rooms, message posting that can be a simple text or files, creation and management of user, 
activity complete history with advanced search (ferret/sphinx), message tracking (rss/atom/e-mail), interface
